My name is Jason Bergunder. I am a Co-founder of my small business called StaticGrass Creations, and I am an aspiring graphic designer. I am always looking for commissions to do miniature model painting and I would like to be employed in the field of media arts, which would include graphic design, animation, and film. A weakness that is currently hindering me is that I do not feel confident in my abilities as a graphic designer to pursue a career in design very readily. The best way to address that weakness is to keep practicing my skills until I am as confident in them as I am in painting miniature models.

Talk about process, getting started on a project in design. Algorithms, heuristics, etc. Tag lines, metaphors. Weakness is iffy, can give someone something to think about to help me. Explaining how to overcome is good.

Talk about what SGC does. Go more in depth into what I like, where I want to go into. SGC latter half, use as experience piece. What does everything have in common, how to tie together into what I want to do. Attention to detail, tie model painting with media, etc.

My name is Jason and I am a co-founder of a small business called StaticGrass Creations. StaticGrass Creations is a miniature model paitning and assembly company. Potential clients contact me via email after they view my work on blogs and forums, to negotiate a price for their project. These projects can span from a few models to a few hundred models all painted to fit a certain theme or colour scheme. In addition to that, I create tutorials of the model making process and advanced paitning techniques to upload to Youtube and give back to the hobby community.
