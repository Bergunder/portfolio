		<p><h3>Step 1: Take a look at my work</h3></p>
		<p>I am a miniature model painter, not a house painter. These can include miniature houses, vehicles, and people, but not actual houses, vehicles, and people. Please take a look at my <a class="infogallerylink" href="gallery.html">gallery</a> or my <a class="infogallerylink" href="blog.html">hobby blog</a> for a better idea.</p>
		<p><h3>Step 2: What would you like to have done</h3></p>
		<p>Take a moment to contemplate what you would like to have done. They could be models that you currently have, or they can be newly purchased ones, etc. I have access to a few hobby stores that sell mainstream tabletop wargames like Games Workshop, Privateer Press, and Infinity. I would be happy to check for specific models if needed. Also, have a look at my rates. The sizes of models are based on the 28mm-30mm scale of Games Workshop and Privateer Press miniatures so the prices are ultimately approximations for niche miniatures.</p>
		<p><h3>Step 3: Contact me</h3></p>
		<p>Fill out the form on the <a class="infogallerylink" href="contact.html">contact me</a> page. I always welsome questions. If you know what you would like done, have links to pictures for inspiration or whatever might help me envision the theme of the models. In the message section, please be as detailed as possible for the most accurate quote. Include the name of the models (company name if an obscure set), number to be done, quality of the work for each model, colour scheme or theme, and anything else that you can think of that would be helpful.</p>
		<p><h2>Remember to read the terms and conditions further down the page!</h2></p>

	<div class="commissionRates">
		<p><h3>My Rates</h3></p>
		<p>All prices include assembly, priming, and basic basing (rocky sand flock or grass). All prices are subject to negotiation and change (unusal amount of detail might increase the cost, smaller than usual model may decrease the cost, etc.)</p>
		<div class="standard">
			<p><h1>Tabletop Standard</h1></p>
			<p>This uses a minimum of 3 colours in the colour scheme. There will be flat colouring and minimal use of washes and highlighting. This standard is recommended for grunts and basic troops for an army or large collection.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="standard">
			<p><h1>Detailed Standard</h1></p>
			<p>This standard bring a little more pazazz to the models. There will be highlighting, some weathering, and shading. More things will put into the models to have them stand out more in both "wow factor" and quality of painting. This standard is recommended for the special groups of models in an army or collection.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="standard">
			<p><h1>Display Quality</h1></p>
			<p>This is the highest quality painting we offer. There will be highlighting, weathering, shading, blending, and other awesome sounding techniques. We will discuss how the model will look in terms of height and any custom made modifications needed. This standard is recommended for army generals and center piece models.</p>
